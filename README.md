# Cars_Assembly
n this exercise you'll be writing code to analyze the production of an assembly line in a car factory. The assembly line's speed can range from 0 (off) to 10 (maximum).  At its lowest speed (1), 221 cars are produced each hour. The production increases linearly with the speed. So with the speed set to 4, it should produce 4 * 221 = 884 cars per hour. However, higher speeds increase the likelihood that faulty cars are produced, which then have to be discarded.
